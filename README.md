# Geraldton District Hospital - Case Study 
In Geraldton District Hospital website user can look at department timings and information, so they can walk in to hospital for treatment.For volunteers, they can look at volunteer opportunities ,if they are interested they can register and fill "Volunteer Applications". Hospital Management can update or delete department timings and volunteer opportunities accordingly. My approach is to provide all the informations over the website that helps the user. There will be three type of users.
- Registered 
- Non-Registered
- Admin
